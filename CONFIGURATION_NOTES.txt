A series of notes-in-progress about AFE configuration.

***Useful Tools***

git log --name-status --graph --oneline

git diff --name-only <tag>

diffnodes (checks the five active nodes)

**Later**

[ ] EventID (tagging) file updated or maybe recreated from scratch due to naming changes

[ ] Some of the AFE Turnouts single lines (e.g not AF relays, which is done)
    don't have their veto-mode connections configured.  

[ ] Remote image panel needs to be updated with full controls once veto config in place

[ ] Set Disable on appropriate sensor icons before publishing panels to club

** Soon **

[ ] Local image panel needs to be updated with full controls

[ ] Can't copy and paste full Line 1 tab from AFE Turnouts to a new node

**This week**

[X] Names for C1 - T2 were redone; changed names in panel file to agree
    
[X] Does Peter want final virtual panels to be photographic or schematic?
        Schematic, maybe Layout Editor

[X] Need to fix NPE in openlcb.jar when redoing a refresh in the Configure Node window
        Proximate cause:  Previous PP failed to quit fully
        
[X] East Xover needs twr, panel controls - alternating control
    Will need an alternate event in it's node - already there
    (Lamp priority might be wrong, needs a check)

[X] Slip area Tower connections need to be done in nodes
        TO polarity now thought to be OK

[X] AFE 3,4 East needs configuring on physical panel

[X] AFE 1-4 needs to be configured on nodes

[X] For consistency with the other channels, move Toggle to Event 5 on AF Relay 14. 
    Requires changes of Event IDs in PP panel sensor(s) and in the panel twr node.

[X] Arrange for old and new panels to coexist (see PMRRM_2023-09-25_update_format.xml)



[ ] Need to resolve the issue with TOs changing at panel startup
    One approach is to remove the individual TOs from the production panel
        But why are the lamps and sensor buttons not properly initializing?
    Alternately, set the ladder with multiple events from initializing button
        How to trigger multiple events from panel? - Use routes

S: 02.01.12.FE.53.E7                     Producer/Consumer Event Report with EventID:02.01.57.00.01.9C.00.84
  Event: AFE Caboose ladder 1 Thrown request
         Turnout AFE Cabooose ladder 1 Thrown
S: 02.01.12.FE.53.E7                     Producer/Consumer Event Report with EventID:02.01.57.00.01.9C.00.9D
  Event: AFE T2 C1 Closed request
         Turnout AFE T2 C1 Closed
S: 02.01.12.FE.53.E7                     Producer/Consumer Event Report with EventID:02.01.57.00.01.9C.00.A9
  Event: AFE Caboose 1-2 Closed request
         Turnout AFE Caboose 1-2 chkd Closed



[ ] "APE cross AF" button needs to be configured (needs to confirm returning events)
        EventID:02.01.57.00.01.9D.00.79
          Event: AFE X-over to APE Closed request
                 Turnout AFE Cross AP Closed
        EventID:02.01.57.00.01.9D.00.78
          Event: AFE X-over to APE Thrown request
                 Turnout AFE Cross AP Thrown
    Node 02.01.57.00.01.9D is APE (not AFE) turnouts, check for alternating


** Previously done **

[X] Add power selectors for AFE1-5 to panel, to nodes

[X] Right TWR 15, 16 not yet assigned uses (assigned to slip buttons)

[X] Left TWR not configured at all
