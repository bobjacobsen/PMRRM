Tags are used to capture the contents after various work efforts. Note that tags start with the date tagged. See notebooks for more info about what dates are what. 

The `Profile` directory contains JMRI profiles.  Their names start with the computer that normally runs them, e.g. the `Dispatch` computer or the `AFE` computer.

The `Archive` directory contains old backups and JMRI profiles from an earlier effort for the AFE RPi.
