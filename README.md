Git tags are used to capture the contents after various work efforts. Note that tags start with the date tagged. See notebooks for more info about what dates are what. 

Documentation is done in .md files in Markdown format.  Start with the README.md file in each directory.

The `Profile` directory contains JMRI profiles.  Their names start with the computer that normally runs them, e.g. the `Dispatch` computer or the `AFE` computer.
